This was evidenced by his careless handling of radioactive material in Sector 7G. His actions show #carelessness #recklessness #lackofsafetyconsciousness. Despite multiple warnings from other employees and the safety protocols in place, Frank mishandled a container of radioactive waste, causing a spill that required extensive cleanup. When Homer Simpson arrived to help, Frank became defensive and blamed Homer for distracting him, displaying #lackofaccountability #blamingothers.\n", "sentiment": -73.61, "adjectives": ["poor", "radioactive", "carelessness", "multiple", "other", "radioactive", "extensive", "defensive"], "observer": "MontgomeryBurns", "lastModified": "2023-04-09T01:18:50"}
