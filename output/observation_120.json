This was evidenced by his careless handling of radioactive material in Sector 7G. His actions show #carelessness #recklessness #lackofsafetyconsciousness. Despite multiple warnings from other employees and the safety protocols in place, Frank mishandled a container of radioactive waste, causing a spill that required extensive cleanup. When Homer Simpson arrived to help, Frank became defensive and blamed Homer for distracting him, displaying #lackofaccountability #blamingothers.\n", "observer": "MontgomeryBurns", "lastModified": "2023/04/08 16:46:41"}
